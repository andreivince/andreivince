# Andrei Vince

Backend & Cloud Engineer focused on systems that scale fast, cost little, and stay online.

I build infrastructure that behaves like software — measurable, minimal, and built to survive.

**Now**
- SWE Intern @ **SuperKey** — architecting real-time Salesforce → AWS RDS sync with API Gateway + Lambda.  
  Building full IaC stacks with AWS CDK and production monitoring via CloudWatch / Chatbot.
- Developing **MarketStream**, an open-source AWS pipeline template for real-time data ingestion.  
  Benchmarked at 2.3M events in 88 min with p95 latency at 53 ms.
- Continuing research at UNC Charlotte on **AI-driven architectural generation** — LLMs, 3D Cellular Automata, and Diffusion models.  
  Poster accepted to **SIGGRAPH Asia 2025**.

**Previously**
- Research intern @ UNC Charlotte × SABRI Lab — generative geometry automation using Python, Rhino, and Stable Diffusion.  
- Built **Vesper**, a voice AI assistant powering my portfolio (Next.js + FastAPI + OpenAI Realtime API).  
- **HackGT 12 Winner** — Best Developer Tool (Warp track).

**Stack**
AWS (CDK · Lambda · API Gateway · DynamoDB Streams · RDS · S3 · SQS · CloudWatch/X-Ray)  
TypeScript · Python · Go · FastAPI · Next.js · SwiftUI · Terraform

**Principles**
> Small systems, big leverage.  
> Code and infrastructure are the same craft.  
> Reliability is not optional.

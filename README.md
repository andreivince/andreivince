# Andrei Vince – Cloud Engineer & Builder 🛠️

I’m building cloud-native backend systems with a focus on speed, observability, and cost-efficiency.

Currently designing a real-time market data pipeline using AWS CDK (TypeScript), Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. Fully serverless. Fully IaC. Goal: 1M+ requests/month with p95 latency under 150ms and infra cost <$10/month.

I care about:
- Clean infrastructure as code
- Production-grade architecture
- GitHub Actions & CI/CD for automated, lean deployments
- Documenting my learning and execution in public

🛠️ **Core Stack:**  
`AWS CDK` • `Lambda` • `DynamoDB` • `API Gateway` • `TypeScript` • `CloudWatch/X-Ray`
